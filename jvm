A general rule is to allocate 75-80% of the pod's memory to the heap to leave room for non-heap usage.

For a 10 GB pod:

Heap allocation: ~7.5 GB to 8 GB.
Recommended values:
-Xms7g -Xmx7g


For a 10 GB pod:

Heap: ~7.5 GB (-Xms7g -Xmx7g).
Metaspace: ~256 MB (-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=256m).
Threads: ~256 MB (-Xss1m x ~256 threads).
Other JVM needs: ~500 MB.
Kubernetes overhead: ~1 GB.


When assigning 15GB of memory to a Kubernetes pod running a Java application, here’s how you should configure the -Xms and -Xmx values for optimal performance while leaving room for other JVM and non-JVM processes.

Key Recommendations
Reserve Memory for Non-Heap Usage:

JVM uses memory outside the heap for:
Thread stacks.
GC overhead.
Metaspace.
Direct buffers, etc.
Rule of thumb: Reserve 30-40% of total pod memory for these processes.
Heap Memory Allocation:

Allocate 60-70% of the pod memory for heap (-Xms and -Xmx).
For 15GB, heap memory should be around 9-10.5GB.
Set -Xms and -Xmx to the Same Value:

Prevents dynamic resizing of the heap.
Example: -Xms10g -Xmx10g.
Leave Space for Kubernetes Overhead:

Kubernetes resources like sidecar containers or logging/monitoring agents might consume some memory.
Ensure the total memory usage (JVM + non-JVM) stays within the pod limit.
